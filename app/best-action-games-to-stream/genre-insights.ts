    challenge: `look, I'm just gonna say it - most action game streams are mid. like genuinely unwatchable mid. and it's not because action games are bad, it's because there's this weird middle ground where you're not good enough to be impressive but not bad enough to be funny. spent way too long watching action streams trying to figure out what works. turns out it's basically two paths - either you're actually cracked or you're genuinely entertaining when you fail. the middle is where streams go to die. harsh but true.`,
    opportunity: `here's what the numbers say though - games like Hades, Dead Cells, Sifu have way better ratios than you'd expect. roguelike action specifically. why? because every run is different, deaths are expected, and there's always "one more run" energy that keeps viewers around. if you're streaming action, pick something with replayability. one-and-done action games (beat it once, never touch it again) are content deserts.`,
    advice: `and honestly? if you're gonna die a lot, lean into it. "I am bad at video games" is a more honest brand than pretending you're good. so pick either be really good at action, play games with great stories, or embrace being bad at it. don't pick games where skill is literally everything if you don't have the skill. people watch for personality + gameplay, not just gameplay.`

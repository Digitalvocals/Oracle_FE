    challenge: `survival games have this weird problem that nobody admits: early death ends your stream. like you spend 20 minutes building, looting, establishing, then one mistake and... stream's over. or you get unlucky. that's not guaranteed content. plus viewers get frustrated watching survival streamers make obviously dumb decisions. "why didn't you build shelter?" the engagement becomes negative.`,
    opportunity: `BUT - and this is the thing that surprised me - survival audiences are insanely loyal. like people come back specifically for YOUR streams. if you're actually competent and entertaining, they follow you religiously. the unlock is multiplayer. solo survival is a slog. but multiplayer survival? that's chaos. you've got group dynamics, resource competition, betrayals, funny moments. Games like Rust, ARK, Valheim co-op - watching a group navigate survival is way more interesting than watching one person solo.`,
    advice: `the other thing: players who take calculated risks beat players who never die. viewers WANT drama. they want to see you in danger, making tough calls, narrowly surviving. boring survival (hiding in a base all stream) is actually boring. and if you're playing multiplayer, lean into the group interactions. that's your actual content - not whether you survive, but the relationships, arguments, funny moments that happen along the way.`

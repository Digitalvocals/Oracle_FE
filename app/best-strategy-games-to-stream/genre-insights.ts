    challenge: `strategy games are interesting because they seem niche, which they are, but the data on viewer loyalty is actually insane. I looked at turn-based tactics and 4X games and found something weird: basically zero competition. like categories with hundreds of viewers and single-digit streamers. that ratio doesn't exist anywhere else. why? because most gaming streamers think strategy is boring. fast-paced action is "real content." strategy is too slow, too methodical, too brain-heavy.`,
    opportunity: `but the people who DO watch strategy? they're ride or die. loyal, engaged, chatting constantly. small communities but tight communities. the thing is you actually have to know what you're doing. you can't fake it in strategy games. viewers are analyzing your plays, seeing your mistakes, thinking about what you should have done differently. games to look at: any turn-based tactics (Slay the Spire, Tactics Ogre, Fire Emblem), 4X games (Civilization, Crusader Kings, Stellaris), even roguelike deck builders.`,
    advice: `the best strategy streamers literally think out loud. they're not executing perfect plays silently - they're saying "here's my gameplan, here's why I'm doing this, here's what could go wrong." viewers eat that up because they're learning while watching. also important: stream when you're mentally fresh. strategy streams are taxing. if you're tired or fried, it shows immediately. people want to see good decision-making.`

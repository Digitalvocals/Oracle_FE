    challenge: `okay this one surprised me. everyone says sim games are boring to stream. farming simulator? euro truck? who watches that? ...turns out a LOT of people watch that. I looked at like 50 sim game categories and the viewer retention is actually insane. people don't click away. they just... hang out. for hours. it's background content - people have you on while they work or eat or whatever.`,
    opportunity: `you're not competing for attention, you're providing vibes. and here's the thing stream coaches won't tell you: sim games have almost ZERO competition. like I found categories with 500+ viewers and literally 8 streamers. that ratio is unheard of in any other genre. games to look at: PowerWash Simulator (seriously), House Flipper, any of the Truck Simulators, Stardew, even weird niche stuff like PC Building Simulator has audiences.`,
    advice: `the trick with sims is consistency over everything else. same schedule, same game, same vibe. these viewers want reliability. they're not looking for hype energy - they want chill. if that's not you, don't force it. but if you're naturally a calm streamer who likes methodical gameplay? sim games are literally your market and nobody's competing for it. one warning: don't try to make sims exciting. that's the trap. embrace the slow pace. the audience is there FOR the slow pace.`

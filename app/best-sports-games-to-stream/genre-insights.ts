    challenge: `I'll be honest - sports games are probably the hardest genre to crack as a small streamer. and not for the reason you'd think. it's not skill. it's that sports game viewers would rather PLAY than watch. like... why watch someone else's FIFA ultimate team when you could be grinding yours? the value proposition is weird.`,
    opportunity: `but there's a hack that actually works: narrative. franchise modes, career modes, rebuild challenges - anything with a STORY. "can I take the worst team in the league to a championship" is watchable. random exhibition matches are not. the other thing that works? retro sports games have cult audiences. NCAA Football 14 has a whole community of people who refuse to move on. old wrestling games. NBA Street. these communities are small but DEDICATED and they have basically zero streamers serving them.`,
    advice: `if you're gonna stream modern sports games (madden, fifa, nba 2k), you need a hook: competitive ranked grind with commentary, challenge runs with weird rules, or community leagues where viewers play against you. just playing the game isn't enough. the game isn't the content - YOU are the content, and the game is the backdrop. more true for sports than any other genre honestly. and look... if you actually know the sport? like REALLY know it - talk about it. break down plays, explain strategy, react to real-life games. sports knowledge is your differentiator.`

    challenge: `indie games seem like they're built for small streamers right? literally zero competition in most categories, plus dev communities. except here's the problem: there are like 5000 indie games released per year. most are completely unplayable. so how do you know which ones to stream? I looked at successful indie streamers and the pattern is clear: they're picky as hell. they're not streaming every trending indie game. they're curating. watching reviews, watching clips, making sure the game is actually good before they touch it.`,
    opportunity: `because streaming a mediocre game to zero people isn't content - it's just wasting time. but here's where it gets interesting: indie dev communities are actually responsive. if you stream a good indie game, engage with the dev, tweet about it, show you care... developers will promote you. for free. it's word-of-mouth marketing that actually works. the unlock is finding genuinely good indie games and becoming the person who discovered them for your audience.`,
    advice: `you're not competing against other streamers - you're competing with the game's visibility. make the game visible, people show up. also: indie audiences tend to be really engaged and cool. the people watching indie games are there specifically because they care about indie games. you build real relationships. so the strategy: be intentional about what you stream. look at reviews, watch gameplay, make sure it's actually good. then engage with the community and dev. tweet about it, tag the devs, get involved.`

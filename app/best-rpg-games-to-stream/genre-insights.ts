    challenge: `I looked at like 40 different RPG streams trying to understand why some build communities and others just... exist. the problem everyone faces is spoilers. you're streaming a story game and instantly you've got people who haven't played avoiding you (don't want spoilers), people who have played already (already know the story), people watching for their first time but not chatting (don't want to get spoiled). so the engagement dies. you're basically narrating to silent people.`,
    opportunity: `but here's what surprised me: RPG audiences are the MOST loyal of any genre. like if someone shows up to an RPG stream, they come back. consistently. every stream. the engagement metrics are insane. the key is picking the right RPGs - games with build variety like Baldur's Gate 3, Dark Souls, Path of Exile where your playstyle matters. viewers get invested in YOUR specific build/approach, not just the story. or indie RPGs that are actually short - 10-20 hours, not 100.`,
    advice: `avoid 60-hour JRPGs where you're stuck in one game for like 4 months. your audience gets bored waiting for you to finish. and here's the thing: RPG viewers WANT the story experience with you. don't skip dialogue, don't rush cutscenes. they're there for the journey, not speedruns. lean into that. have actual reactions, discuss the story, let them experience it with you instead of narrating passively.`

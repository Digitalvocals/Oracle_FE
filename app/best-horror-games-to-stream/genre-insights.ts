    challenge: `okay this one's weird because horror seems like it should be perfect for small streamers. reaction content = free clips, right? genuine jump scares, authentic fear, people share that on Twitter... sounds perfect. except when I looked at actual horror stream data, there's this thing nobody talks about: most horror games are 3-6 hours long and then done. one and done. you beat Amnesia once, you're not replaying it. so a streamer plays one horror game, gets some clips, then what? move to the next game? now your channel is just horror game #47.`,
    opportunity: `the streamers making it work are doing something different. replayable horror - games with roguelike elements or multiplayer. Phasmophobia (multiplayer ghost hunting), Grounded (co-op survival horror), Risk of Rain 2 (roguelike chaos). every run is different, deaths are expected, viewers understand "one more run" mentality. or really long horror with personality requirements where you're genuinely experiencing it WITH your chat, not just screaming at jump scares for clips.`,
    advice: `the thing that kills horror streams: solo, new game every time, fake reactions. the thing that works: community horror (multiplayer), extended horror (long stories), or consistent horror (same game, challenge runs). and honestly? multiplayer horror specifically. watching one person scream at a game gets old. watching a group of friends try not to piss themselves while communicating? that's infinite content.`

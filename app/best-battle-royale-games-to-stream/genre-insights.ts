    challenge: `BR games look incredible to stream. constant action, natural drama, built-in tension. except when I actually tracked BR streams, there's this brutal pattern: if you're not placing top 3 and getting kills, it's... hard to watch. like watching someone loot buildings for 10 minutes then get sniped in the first fight? that's not compelling content. and the saturated ones (Fortnite, Warzone) are so dominated by skilled players that new streamers just drown.`,
    opportunity: `but here's what works: consistency beats skill for BR. I tracked smaller BRs with less competition and the data shows that people care way more about "streamer shows up same time every day" than "streamer gets 10 kills a game." why? because BR games are short cycles. 5-20 minutes per game. viewers can tune in for a quick session, hang out, clip moments, then peace out. it's less commitment than other games.`,
    advice: `the other thing: BR streamers who engage chat between games actually build audiences. the downtime between matches is when personality shows. if you're silent while waiting for next match, people leave. but if you're joking with chat, talking about past plays, trash talking... people stick around. also BRs are insane for clips. last-circle drama, clutch moments, funny fails. clip it, post it, drive traffic back.`

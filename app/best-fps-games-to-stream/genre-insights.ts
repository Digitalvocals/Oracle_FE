    challenge: `alright so I spent way too much time analyzing FPS streams trying to figure out why so many just... fail. the answer is brutal: if you're not naturally gifted at aiming, FPS audiences will clock you immediately and leave. like there's no hiding mediocrity in a genre where every fight is a 1v1 skill check. pro players and ex-esports people dominate, and unless you're in that tier, most FPS channels hit zero.`,
    opportunity: `but here's what I found that actually works: niche tactical shooters. games like Squad, Insurgency, Ready or Not - these have real audiences. not huge audiences, but way less competition than Valorant or CS2. and more importantly? they reward TEAMWORK and COMMUNICATION over pure aim. so a smaller team of coordinated players beats randos every time, which means viewers see constant wins without needing to be a pro.`,
    advice: `if you're gonna stream FPS, pick tactical shooters, find a consistent team, and stream when they're available. don't try to compete with aim gods. find the games where aim is 30% and teamwork is 70%. and honestly? every successful FPS stream has friends or a squad. playing solo FPS where you're queuing random teams? viewers immediately peace out.`

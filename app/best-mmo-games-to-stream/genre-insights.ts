    challenge: `MMOs have this brutal gatekeep problem that nobody talks about. WoW and FF14 are so dominant that if you're a new streamer in those games, you're invisible. established players, guilds, streamers already own the space. the barrier to entry is insane - you need to be known AND good AND entertaining just to get noticed.`,
    opportunity: `but here's what I found: newer MMOs and lesser-known ones have massive communities looking for streamers. like people actively searching "is there a streamer for this game?" and finding nothing. Games that should have way more streamer presence: Eso, SWTOR, GW2, even some F2P MMOs. active communities, engaged players, basically zero streamer representation. the unlock is commitment. pick ONE MMO and commit. don't bounce around.`,
    advice: `build a guild, create community events, get people invested in your specific journey. these audiences want to feel part of something, not watch a streamer sample different games. also: stream during off-peak hours for your game. your competition is the actual game's population. if you stream during primetime, you're competing with everyone who's just playing instead of watching. but 2 AM? 6 AM? you're the only option. the loyalty is insane once you build it though.`

    challenge: `MOBA viewers are hardcore. like genuinely some of the most engaged audiences in gaming. also genuinely some of the most toxic lol. and here's the thing that kills small streamer MOBA channels: skill gatekeep is REAL. League and Dota audiences expect diamond/immortal minimum. if you're hardstuck plat or gold, viewers will just... leave immediately. no chat, no follow, just gone. they can smell elo fraud a mile away.`,
    opportunity: `I spent a lot of time in MOBA communities and there's basically a tier system - Challenger gets thousands, Diamond+ gets hundreds, Plat-Gold gets tens, below that basically invisible. it's brutal. but here's where the opportunity actually is: alternative MOBAs. Heroes of the Storm, Smite, even older games like Hon have communities that still exist. and they're actually looking for streamers. like people genuinely want to find creators for their game and there's barely anyone streaming.`,
    advice: `the audiences are smaller but they're WAY less toxic. and if you're a decent player in an alternative MOBA, you can actually build something. also: be honest about your rank. don't hide it, don't pretend. MOBA viewers will call you out instantly if you're lying. pick a role, master it, and actually explain your decisions on stream. don't just play - think out loud. MOBA audiences want to learn from you.`
